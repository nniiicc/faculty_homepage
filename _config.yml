        Joe lives with his wife and three daughters in Newnan, Georgia. Every
        summer, Joe teaches high school students how to write games during an
        intense weeklong course in North Carolina for Landry Academy. In his free
        time, Joe dabbles in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When
        you see his artistic creations, youâ€™ll understand why he makes his living
        as a programmer.
