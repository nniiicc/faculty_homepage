# Prospective Students
I am currently accepting PhD students that would like to do research in the field of Information Science and Social Computing. To get an idea of the kinds of projects you could work on as a part of my research group you can see my [research page.](/projects)    

I mostly conduct mixed-methods and qualitative research. If you are interested in doing data science research I am likely not a good advisor for you. However, I regularly co-advise and sit on committees for students that work in the [DataLab](datalab.ischool.uw.edu).

You can find more information about the UW iSchool's PhD program here.
